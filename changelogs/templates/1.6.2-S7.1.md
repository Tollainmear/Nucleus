# IMPORTANT: Deprecation of GeoIP module

GeoIP will be removed from Nucleus in 1.7. This is due to low usage and the fact it isn't really consider "essential". However, do not fret, as 
Nucleus Heisenberg replaces the GeoIP module with equal functionality.

I am having difficulties with Ore at the moment and as such, Heisenberg has not been fully published on Ore. It will be announced soon. 

# New Features

* Added `-a` command flag to `/clearinventory` to clear everything
* Added `NucleusClearInventoryEvent`s for other plugins to hook into.
